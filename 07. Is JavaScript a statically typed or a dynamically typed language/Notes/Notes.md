### 7. **Is JavaScript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?**


# JavaScript: Statically Typed or Dynamically Typed?

**JavaScript** is a **dynamically typed language**. 

This means that you do not need to define the data type of a variable when you declare it. The type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value it holds.

### Key Points:
1. **Dynamic Typing**: The type of a variable can change during the execution of the program.
   ```javascript
   let x = 10;    // x is a number
   x = "Hello";   // Now x is a string
   ```

2. **No Type Declarations**: In JavaScript, variables are not tied to specific types, and their types can change throughout the program.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let myVar = 42;    // myVar is a number
   myVar = "JavaScript";  // Now myVar is a string
   ```

### Note:
JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning the type of a variable is determined during runtime and can change as the program executes.
