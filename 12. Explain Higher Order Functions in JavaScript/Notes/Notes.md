### **12: Explain Higher Order Functions in JavaScript.**

#### **Answer:**

**Higher Order Functions** are functions that can do one or more of the following:

1. **Take another function as an argument** – You can pass a function into another function as a parameter.
2. **Return a function as a result** – A function can return another function.

In simple terms, a higher-order function is a function that either accepts a function as a parameter, returns a function, or both.

#### **Examples of Higher Order Functions:**

1. **Passing a Function as an Argument:**

   You can pass a function as an argument to another function. This is commonly done with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` in JavaScript.

   Example using `map()`:
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function(num) { 
     return num * 2; // This function is passed to map
   });
   console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
   ```

   In this case, `map()` is a higher-order function because it takes a function as its argument.

2. **Returning a Function from Another Function:**

   A function can also return another function. This allows for more flexible code and is often used in closures.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function multiplyBy(factor) {
     return function(number) {
       return number * factor; // Returning a function
     };
   }

   const multiplyBy2 = multiplyBy(2);
   console.log(multiplyBy2(5)); // 10
   const multiplyBy3 = multiplyBy(3);
   console.log(multiplyBy3(5)); // 15
   ```

   Here, `multiplyBy()` is a higher-order function because it returns a new function.

#### **Why are Higher Order Functions Useful?**

- **Code Reusability:** You can create more flexible and reusable functions. By passing different functions to higher-order functions, you can use the same function in different contexts.
  
- **Cleaner Code:** Higher-order functions often allow you to write cleaner, more concise code without needing to repeat yourself. For example, `map()` or `filter()` can replace a lot of loops, making your code easier to read.

- **Powerful Functionality:** They enable things like **function composition**, **callbacks**, and **closures**, which are fundamental for more advanced JavaScript programming.

#### **Common Higher Order Functions in JavaScript:**
- `map()` – Transforms each element of an array based on a function.
- `filter()` – Filters elements of an array based on a condition.
- `reduce()` – Reduces all elements of an array to a single value based on a function.
- `forEach()` – Iterates over each element in an array and performs an action using a function.

Example using `filter()`:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0; // Returns only even numbers
});
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]
```

### **Note:**
A **higher-order function** is simply a function that either:
- Takes a function as an argument, or
- Returns a function as a result.

Higher-order functions are powerful tools in JavaScript that help you write more reusable, clean, and efficient code.
